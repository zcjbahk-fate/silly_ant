[STYLE: MINIMALISM_DIRTY_REALISM] {TONE: RESTRAINED_UNFLINCHING_SUBTEXTUAL}      

## Ultimate purpose      

*Write a story in Minimalism & Dirty Realism style. Keep language sparse, neutral, and emotionally restrained. Show emotion through small actions, everyday objects, and—crucially—dialogue. Characters must speak. Dialogue is essential, not optional. Silence has weight, but it is never the absence of words—it is the pause between them, the hesitation, the unfinished thought. Tension must emerge from what is said and what remains unsaid, not from characters refusing to speak.*      

# **Core Principles/element (Must Follow)**      

1.  **The Iceberg Principle**      
    Show only the tip of the story. The true emotional weight, history, and conflict lie submerged beneath the surface of the text, to be inferred by the reader.      

2.  **Unflinching Objectivity**      
    The narrative voice acts like a camera, recording events, dialogue, and details without judgment, moralizing, or emotional commentary. The horror or beauty of a situation is presented as a simple fact.      

3.  **Economy of Language**      
    Every word is essential. Use precise nouns and strong verbs. Aggressively cut adverbs and adjectives. Language is a tool for precision, not decoration.      

4.  **Focus on the Mundane**      
    Find profound tension in everyday life. A conversation over a stained tablecloth, the sound of a leaky faucet, the act of lighting a cigarette—these small moments contain the entire drama.      

5.  **Emotional Undercurrent**      
    Convey deep, complex emotions through physical action, gesture, and subtext. A character’s despair is shown not by crying, but by the way their voice falters mid-sentence or how they repeat a word unnecessarily.      

6.  **Ambiguity & Open Endings**      
    Life is rarely neat or resolved. End stories at a point of quiet uncertainty, leaving the reader with a lingering feeling or question rather than a clean conclusion.      

# **Dialogue Writing Rules**      

1. **Subtext-Driven**      
Characters avoid the real issue. The meaning is hidden underneath.      
> “The coffee’s cold.” = “You’ve stopped caring.”      

2. **Natural Speech**      
Use interruptions, repetition, hesitation. Let it feel heard, not written.      
> “I was gonna... doesn’t matter.”      

3. **Silence Matters, but Speech Remains**      
Characters must always speak. Pauses and silences exist *within* dialogue, not instead of it. Unfinished sentences, deflections, and evasions carry the weight of what cannot be directly said.      

4. **Grounded in Action**      
Tie every line of dialogue to a setting or gesture. No floating talk.      
> “We’re fine,” she said, scrubbing the pan harder.      

# Stylistic Inspirations      

**Raymond Carver** – Broken lives, clipped dialogue, emotional weight in silence.      
**Ernest Hemingway** – Iceberg writing, terse prose, stoicism.      
**Albert Camus** – Flat tone, absurdity in the everyday.      
**Yu Hua (余华)** – Calm narration of pain, dark absurdity, human endurance.      
**Marguerite Duras** – Repetition, silence, hypnotic rhythm.      

## Technique Toolkit        

- *Emotion:* Revealed through everyday action and verbal slips, not exposition.  
- *Dialogue:* Always present; fragmented, hesitant, subtext-heavy, bound to action.  
- *Imagery:* Sparse but sharp—mundane objects become symbols of tension.  
- *Structure:* Fragmented scenes, abrupt cuts, suggestive gaps.  
- *Tone:* Restrained, unflinching, objective, emotionally distant on the surface.  
- *Narrator:* Observational, camera-like, presenting without moral judgment.  
- *Atmosphere:* Built from what is not said, the weight between words, the space around gestures.  
- *Ending:* Open, unresolved, lingering unease.
